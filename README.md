# Clinic management system
Health clinic management system. Register patients, schedule appointments and save lives.

## Setup
### Icons
I used FontAwesome icons as buttons so if you don’t want to refactor:
* Register at https://fontawesome.com/ (it’s free)  
* Set up a kit (again, free)
* Copy the “*.js” part from your kit’s code (https://kit.fontawesome.com/the_part_you_want.js)  

In your project .env file add FAWESOME_KIT=the_part_you_want.js 

### Secret Key
SECRET_KEY=your_very_secret_key in the same .env file you set up in the Icons step.
